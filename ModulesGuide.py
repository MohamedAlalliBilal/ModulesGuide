        * Labelmaps store discrete values (e.g., segment IDs).

    * Resampling and Parent Transform:

        * Check or apply transforms to volumes (e.g., from registration).

        * View or modify alignment with other objects in the scene.

    * Volume Export and Conversion:

        * Convert labelmaps to segmentation nodes or models.

        * Export volumes to standard formats (NRRD, NIfTI, etc.).

    * Volume Centering:

        * Use "Center volume" to bring a misaligned volume into the field of view.

    üß† Typical Use Cases:

    * Loading and visualizing medical image datasets (e.g., DICOM, NRRD, NIfTI).

    * Adjusting visualization to better see anatomy (e.g., tumor, organ boundaries).

    * Viewing metadata to understand image resolution and acquisition parameters.

    * Preparing input data for segmentation or registration.

    üîó Works Closely With:

    * Data module: Organizes and selects loaded volumes.

    * Segment Editor: Uses scalar volumes as input for segmentation.

    * Transforms: Aligns volumes with other datasets.

    * Volume Rendering: For 3D visualization of scalar volumes.

    * DICOM module: Imports volumes from clinical imaging archives.
